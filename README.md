- I have a respecatble amount of experience in HTML and CSS. They are the most simple langauges to learn out there but being able to put both languages into good use is something not done quite correctly. HTML and CSS were made to flow together and in order to allow the natural flow of these two languages together you must have a substanial amount of knowledge which I can confidently say I can do.
